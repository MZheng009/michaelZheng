            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div class="life-stage">
                <h2>Early Childhood</h2>
                <p>
                    I was enrolled in a swim team called Martin Luther King Blue Dolphins. This is where I 
                    developed a lot of communication skills talking to everyone older and younger than me. I 
                    learned to manage time and set goals for myself to reach a certain time for a swim event 
                    I would love to get faster in. When I was at school I would like to explore newer topics 
                    and ask the teacher if there was something harder I could do when I was getting ahead in class. 
                    This carried into my swim career and made me want to get even faster, making it where I 
                    wanted to keep on improving.
                </p>

                <h2>Pre-Teen</h2>
                <p>
                    I was getting faster and faster in swimming, this made me more excited for my next races 
                    making me race kids who were bigger and faster than me. Going into middle school I loved 
                    to learn a lot, this got me into Dungeons and Dragons. Having a hobby outside of school 
                    and swimming helped develop me into a more well-rounded individual, teaching me how to 
                    communicate with people who might not have similar interests as me. Made some close friends 
                    but as time passed it was harder to keep track of people as we got older.

                <h2>High School</h2>
                <p>
                    I really enjoyed this time of my life, exploring new clubs, finding people with similar 
                    interests and learning about their interests. This was when swimming was getting harder 
                    to keep up with and sadly had to part ways due to my parents not being able to drive and 
                    my swimming pool being across the city from my school. Around this time the team was slowly 
                    dying due to the older swimmers moving onto their college careers. This was where I found 
                    dragon boat, I remember when I was 8 years old my older brother did it in High School and 
                    I wondered if Lincoln High School had the same program. I stuck with Dragon Boat, Lion Dance, 
                    Lifting, HS Swimming, and Japanese Culture Club for all 4 years in High School.

                <h2>College</h2>
                <p>
                    The first two years were great, made new friends, worked closely with professors 
                    on projects and got an on-campus job. Joined a Fraternity called Alpha Phi Omega, 
                    this is a CO-ED community service Fraternity. In this organization I ran for 
                    Service Vice President where I helped organize events for our chapter to volunteer at. 
                    Focused on Outrigger Canoe because there was no Dragon Boat team in College and this 
                    brought me onto Team USA U24 division during the Summer of 2019. I was also working at a 
                    Sushi Restaurant to help pay for my travels for Team USA. Then COVID happened in the 
                    second semester of my 3rd year in college Spring of 2020. It was a challenging time to 
                    switch to fully remote classes and some of the older professors were struggling to adapt 
                    to the sudden change.

                <h2>Early Adult</h2>
                <p>
                    After graduating from College I applied everywhere I could for work, 
                    but it was all rejections after rejections. While I was working at the 
                    sushi restaurant I got a hit at a company called EGain. In this instance the 
                    company was the one who reached out to me and I was concerned because I had 
                    heard that this could have been a scam. I did my research and found that it was 
                    a real company and has been around for ages. Got through the interview and started 
                    working at EGain right as the Sushi Restaurant closed, due to the owner wanting to retire.
